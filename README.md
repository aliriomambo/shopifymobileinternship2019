# Shopify Mobile Internship 2019 Challenge
This is a project that was built as a result of my desire to work at Shopify as an Android Intern.

# Problem
You're a successful Shopify merchant with many products in your store! You’d like an easier way of browsing your products from your phone based on the “tags” on each product. Create an Android app that displays a Tags List Page and a Products List Page. Your app will need to fetch data from the Shopify Products REST API.

Tags List Page: A simple list of every unique tag that has been added to one of your products (e.g. Aerodynamic, Clock, Concrete). Clicking on a tag launches the Products List Page.

Products List Page: A list of every product that contains the selected tag. Each row in the list needs to contain, at a minimum, the name of the product and the total available inventory across all variants of the product.
